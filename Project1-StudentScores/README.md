# Project 1: Student Scores Analysis (NumPy + Matplotlib)

In this project, we analyze student scores using NumPy for calculations 
and Matplotlib for visualization.  

## Create a NumPy array of 10 students × 3 subjects with random scores (0–100).
Tasks:
Calculate each student’s average score.
Find the top 3 students.
Plot a bar chart of average scores.

## Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
