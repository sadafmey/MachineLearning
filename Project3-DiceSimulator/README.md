# Project 3: Dice Simulator (NumPy + Matplotlib)

In this project, we simulate rolling two dice 1,000 times using NumPy 
and analyze the results with Matplotlib.

## Tasks
1. Simulate 1,000 rolls of 2 dice.
2. Count how many times each sum (2â€“12) occurs.
3. Calculate the probability of rolling a 7.
4. Plot a histogram of the sums.

## Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
