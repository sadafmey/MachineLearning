# Project 9: Simple Calculator with NumPy

In this project, we use NumPy arrays to perform vectorized mathematical operations instead of loops.

## Tasks
1. Create two NumPy arrays of numbers.
2. Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using vectorized operations.
3. Print the results.

## Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
